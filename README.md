# Development of Diagnostic Solutions for Multi-Node AI Architectures

## Project Overview  
This project aims to develop a diagnostic system that monitors the performance, energy efficiency, and security of a multi-node AI architecture. The architecture uses NVIDIA Jetson Nano devices running Ubuntu Linux, with CUDA for GPU acceleration, and integrates Prometheus for performance monitoring and Grafana for data visualization.  
In this project, I will set up a distributed system where multiple Jetson Nano nodes will run AI workloads, and a central server will collect and display performance data. The goal is to implement real-time monitoring of resource usage, energy consumption, and secure communication between nodes.

## Required Hardware

### Nodes (AI Computing Units)  
- **NVIDIA Jetson Nano OKdo Development Kit:**  
  Each Jetson Nano will serve as a computing node where deep learning models will be deployed and run. The Jetson Nano has a 4-core ARM Cortex-A57 processor and a 128-core Maxwell GPU, which will be used to accelerate AI tasks via CUDA.  
  Each Jetson Nano will be connected to the network and will communicate with the central server to collect data.  
- **Energy Monitoring:**  
  Each Jetson Nano will be equipped with an INA3221 power monitoring sensor, an I2C sensor. This sensor will provide real-time data on the energy consumption of each node, allowing tracking and optimization of energy use.

### Central Monitoring Server  
- **Monitoring Server:**  
  A Linux server (Ubuntu 20.04) will be used to run Prometheus to collect metrics from all Jetson Nano nodes. This server will also run Grafana for data visualization in a dashboard.  
- **Network:**  
  A Gigabit Ethernet switch will ensure fast, low-latency connections between the Jetson Nano nodes and the central server. Communication between nodes and the server will rely on TCP/IP protocols, with secure communication via SSH tunnel.

## Required Software

### Operating System  
- **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS:**  
  Both the Jetson Nano and the central server will run Ubuntu 20.04 LTS to ensure compatibility with CUDA and other required software libraries.

### Performance Monitoring and Visualization  
- **Prometheus:**  
  Prometheus will be used to collect metrics from each Jetson Nano node, including CPU usage, memory, GPU usage, and energy consumption via the INA3221 sensor.  
  Prometheus exporters will be set up on each Jetson Nano to collect custom metrics, such as energy usage and system performance.  
- **Grafana:**  
  Grafana will visualize the data collected by Prometheus, providing dashboards displaying real-time performance information such as CPU usage, GPU load, memory usage, and energy consumption.

### AI Libraries and Frameworks  
- **CUDA:**  
  CUDA will be used to accelerate the computations of AI models running on the Jetson Nano’s GPU. This includes deep learning tasks like object detection, classification, and regression, using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.  
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch:**  
  A basic deep learning model (such as a convolutional neural network for object classification) will be deployed on the Jetson Nano nodes to test both hardware and software.

### Security  
- **OpenSSH:**  
  OpenSSH will be used to establish secure communication between the Jetson Nano nodes and the central server. All remote communications for data collection and monitoring will be encrypted via SSH.  
- **TLS:**  
  To further enhance data exchange security, TLS (Transport Layer Security) will be used to secure communication between nodes and the central server, especially for sensitive data like AI model predictions or sensor readings.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Hardware Installation  
1. **Installing and Configuring the Jetson Nano:**  
   - Flash Ubuntu 20.04 LTS onto each Jetson Nano.  
   - Connect the Jetson Nano nodes to the network and ensure they are functioning correctly.  
   - Install and configure the INA3221 sensor to monitor each node’s energy consumption.  
2. **Configuring the Central Server:**  
   - Set up the central server with Ubuntu and configure it to monitor the Jetson Nano nodes.  
   - Install and configure Prometheus for data collection and Grafana for visualization.

### Phase 2: Software Configuration and Development  
1. **Installing CUDA and AI Frameworks:**  
   - Install CUDA and set up a deep learning framework (either TensorFlow or PyTorch) on the Jetson Nano.  
   - Deploy a basic AI model (such as image classification) on the Jetson Nano nodes to test the interface and performance.  
2. **Configuring Prometheus & Grafana:**  
   - Set up Prometheus exporters on each Jetson Nano to collect system metrics and energy consumption.  
   - Configure Grafana dashboards to visualize these metrics in real time.  
3. **Implementing Security:**  
   - Configure OpenSSH for secure access to the Jetson Nano nodes.  
   - Implement data encryption with TLS for secure communication between nodes and the central server.

### Phase 3: Performance Testing and Optimization  
1. **Monitoring Performance and Energy Consumption:**  
   - Test the AI model on each Jetson Nano (inference time, energy consumption).  
   - Monitor performance in real time via Prometheus and optimize energy consumption using PowerTop.  
2. **Optimizing Latency:**  
   - Minimize latency by adjusting network parameters and communication protocols.

### Phase 4: Documentation and Final Deployment  
1. **Testing and Validation:**  
   - Perform tests to ensure all nodes are being correctly monitored, data is being collected properly, and security measures are effective.  
2. **Documentation Writing:**  
   - Complete documentation on installation, configuration, and troubleshooting procedures.  
   - Deploy the system for production use.
